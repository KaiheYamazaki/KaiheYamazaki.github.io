						<h2><font color="#135C89"> Southern Ocean dynamics - What is the response to a changing climate?</font></h2>
						<div class="row">
                            <p>The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean, surrounds the continent of Antarctica and plays a critical role in the global climate system. It is the only ocean that completely encircles the Earth, and it is the largest of the world's oceanic regions. The Southern Ocean is characterized by strong currents, high winds, and large waves. Antarctic sea ice makes it a challenging environment for scientific study, and particularly <u>ship measurement always suffers from the presence of sea ice</u>.</p>

                            <p>In recent decades, the Southern Ocean has experienced significant changes in temperature, salinity, and sea ice cover, which have been attributed to a changing climate. As global temperatures rise, the Southern Ocean is warming faster than other ocean, with temperatures increasing by around 0.1-0.2°C per decade over the past half century.</p>
                            
                            <img src="images/more/ACC.jpg" alt="IPCC SROCC (2019)" width="600" height="500">

                            <p>One of the key dynamics driving these changes is the Southern Ocean's circumpolar current, which is the largest ocean current in the world. This current flows eastward around Antarctica and acts as a barrier, preventing warmer waters from moving southward and cold Antarctic waters from moving northward. However, the strength and position of the circumpolar current are influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in wind patterns, oceanic eddies, and atmospheric conditions.</p>

                            <p>Changes in the Southern Ocean also have significant impacts on global climate patterns. For example, the Southern Ocean is a major carbon sink, absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, as the ocean warms, its ability to absorb carbon dioxide may be reduced, which could exacerbate the effects of climate change.</p>

                            <p>Overall, understanding the dynamics of the Southern Ocean and its response to a changing climate is critical for predicting and mitigating the impacts of global warming. Ongoing research efforts are focused on developing more accurate models of the Southern Ocean and improving our understanding of the complex interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere.</p>
