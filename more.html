							The Southern Ocean (or Antarctic ocean) plays a fundamental role in the global climate system, particularly in producing the densest and largest seawater on the Earth: Antarctic Bottom Water. The formation of bottom water is the dynamical driver of the global Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). In the Southern Ocean, surface water sinks to the abyssal layer, whereas deep water upwells close the MOC circuit, just like a hub of the global ocean. The MOC is substantial for the global redistribution of heat and carbon.<br /><br />

							<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf">IPCC AR5</a> reported that the deep ocean has warmed over the past several decades, with the most significant warming in the Southern Ocean. This change is remarkable in the tranquil abyssal ocean; however, its cause yet to be disclosed.<br /><br />

								Ice is fundamental for the climate system. The Southern Ocean is adjoining to the Antarctic ice sheet, a giant reservoir of freshwater equivalent to <a href="http://www.floodmap.net/?ll=38.760776,137.429911&z=5&e=60"> 60 m elevation of sea level</a>. Trials to predict future sea-level rise are ongoing. However, there is still a significant uncertainty due to the complexity of the ice sheets response to the oceanic condition.
								<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/">IPCC SROCC</a> would be good to know our findings as a first step.<br />

							The key process is an intrusion of deep warm water from offshore onto the continental shelves. It provides heat which melts the ice shelves. The glacial meltwater causes the sea-level rise and affects the strength of the MOC.<br /><br />

					<div class="major">
					<p>
						<font size="+1">My ultimate goal is <span class="under1">to predict the climate state in the next century</span>. Based on our present knowledge, 
						to understand the Antarctic ocean dynamics is principally important to accomplish it. I started my research career from the bachelor course 
						at Tohoku University. Pilot data of Deep Argo deployed in the Southern Ocean’s Indian sector were analyzed. During the bachelor study, 
						I realized that up to 40 % of Argo profiles in the Antarctic seasonal ice zone are under ice data without satellite-positioned coordinates, 
						which have scarcely been utilized at the time. To promote the use of under-ice Argo, 
						I devised a brand new terrain-following position interpolation scheme and 
						applied it to Argo floats in the Indian sector to derive physically consistent float positions. Along with the under-ice data, 
						I delineated the climatological structure of the subpolar circulation in the Australian-Antarctic Basin (Yamazaki et al., 2020) 
						for the master thesis at Hokkaido University, under the supervision of Shigeru Aoki.</br>
						After this work, I have joined two Japanese Antarctic research cruises (2018/19 R/V Kaiyo-maru KY1804 and 2019/20 Icebreaker Shirase JARE61) 
						and engaged to oceanographic measurement and sea ice observation. Using KY1804 data, Prof. Aoki and I analyzed the historical bottom water 
						salinity change and discovered a reversal of the wide-spread bottom water freshening trend in the Indian sector (Aoki et al., 2020). 
						I further found a multidecadal poleward shift of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and evaluated its dynamical 
						robustness (Yamazaki et al., 2021). During JARE61, we conducted on-shelf hydrography off the Totten Ice Shelf, including the Airborne-XCTD 
						helicopter operation collaborated with a team from University of Texas. 
						My current Ph.D. project is involved with the water exchange from the subpolar circulation to the continental shelves,
						with a particular emphasis on the upcoming impact of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet melting. </br>
